This project aims in predicting the train delay.
For this, a dataset of train delays should be included in code.
From the dataset (arrival station, departure station, arrival time, departure time and delay dataset, app will predict the traindelay.
Also the dataset includes the weather conditions too. 
Some features are added in this code, to work efficiently.
The features are aggregation and threshold-based consistency.
This feature re-checks that there is a train delay or not and provide the accurate data.
